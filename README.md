# Wrangle And Analyze Data Project
## by (Samar Osailan)

### Dataset

> The dataset is gathered from 3 different sources, which are:
1- The WeRateDogs Twitter archive dataset, I dowloaded it manually from the given instructions of the project as twitter_archive_enhanced.csv 
2- The tweet image predictions dataset, I dowloaded it programmatically from the given instructions of the project as a url using Requests library. 
3- The tweets dataframe that is consist of each tweet's retweets and likes. I used python's Tweepy library to store each tweet using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data in a file called tweet_json.txt.
